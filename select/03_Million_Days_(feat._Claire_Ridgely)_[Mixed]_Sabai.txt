I don't do this often
You caught me off guard
All of my friends said you moved out west
You tell me stories underneath sun sets

Could it be more than just one night?
Kiss in the cab ride
Head turning left right
Get a ticket for two
To wherever you choose
Drinking some red out of the blue

You say my name with your accent
Makes me remember
How much I missed you
Hope you're planning to stay
For a million days
You'll be my summer in December

Hey boy
Trust my intuitions
Always
I'm not superstitious
I got lucky
I stole your heart
And it was mine for the taking

I'm bad at pretending, you know I'll be true
Sunday mornings, midnight lights
Turn into songs that you watch me write
Stole your sweater on that night
You took a picture
I keep by my bedside
So you're mine when you're gone
Baby please don't be long
I got my ticket to the westside

You say my name with your accent
Makes me remember
How much I missed you
Hope you're planning to stay
For a million days
You'll be my summer in December

Hey boy
Trust my intuitions
Always
I'm not superstitious
I got lucky
Stole your heart
And it was mine for the taking

It was mine for the taking
It was mine for a million days
Hmm, in a million ways
Stole your heart, and I got lucky
Stole your heart and it was mine in a million ways
Hmm, for a million days
